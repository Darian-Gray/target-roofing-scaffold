# Website form routing

The server saves the submission before attempting the email notification. A saved
lead ID establishes storage success. `notified: true` means SMTP accepted every
notification recipient; it does not prove inbox delivery or a successful reply.

| Form | Default notification recipient | Reply-To | Saved table |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Contact Us | service@targetroofers.com | Customer email; office if absent | leads |
| Free Estimate | projects@targetroofers.com | Customer email; office if absent | leads |
| Softwash | service@targetroofers.com | Customer email; office if absent | leads |
| Roof Cleaning Estimate | projects@targetroofers.com | Customer email; office if absent | leads |
| Prospect Intake | Assigned salesperson plus projects@targetroofers.com | admin@targetroofers.com | prospect_intakes |

Free Estimate links use `/contact?service=free-estimate`. Selecting Free Estimate
on Contact Us also selects the estimate route. Other Contact Us submissions use
the service route. Estimate forms embedded on other pages already use the
estimate route.

`/roof-cleaning-system` redirects to `/softwash?request=roof-cleaning`. Its Schedule
Today link stays on that page's quote form, retaining the query. Roof Cleaning and
Softwash retain their identities in the saved service/message and notification.
Both use the existing `softwash` database form type; no schema migration is needed.

Prospect Intake retains its creator as provenance and routes to the assigned
salesperson. The office copy defaults to projects@ based on the existing office
route. Confirm that mailbox with the office before production acceptance. The
Intake reply default preserves the office reply behavior described in the handoff;
public inquiry notifications reply to the customer. This change does not add a
customer acknowledgment email.

## Configuration

Existing SMTP settings remain in use: `SMTP_HOST`, `SMTP_PORT`, `SMTP_USER`,
`SMTP_PASS`, and `NOTIFY_FROM`. Configure these in the deployment's secret/settings
interface; never commit credentials. A sending-provider change is not required
by this patch.

Recipient overrides remain available through `CONTACT_NOTIFY_TO`, `LEAD_NOTIFY_TO`,
and `SOFTWASH_NOTIFY_TO`. `INTAKE_NOTIFY_TO` overrides the office copy, and
`INTAKE_REPLY_TO` overrides Intake's reply address. Lists support comma-separated
addresses and remove duplicates. Check production overrides: an old nonempty
value takes precedence over the defaults above.

## Validation and release

Run `npm run test:forms`, `npm run test:security`, and `npm run build` on the feature
branch. Keep the production branch unchanged until review and acceptance.

On a reviewed preview or controlled production test, use a unique TEST label and
an authorized customer test inbox. For each of the five routes:

1. Submit through its actual page/link and record the returned saved ID.
2. Find that exact ID in the company Supabase project, including form identity.
3. Confirm the intended inbox received the notification, including both Intake
   recipients. Check spam/quarantine when appropriate.
4. Verify the sender and Reply-To in the received message. Test Reply from the
   recipient inbox and confirm the expected customer/office destination.
5. Check deployment logs for save or notification failures. A thank-you page
   alone does not establish email delivery.

Local tests use mocks/test recorders and do not complete those production checks.
If a notification fails, the saved lead is retained; this patch does not introduce
an automatic retry queue. Staff must follow up on failures found in logs/data.

ProLine broadcasting domain authentication is a separate SendGrid/DNS setup. It
is not changed by these website form fixes.
